%% should be able to save queries similarly to RDBMS
% first time a query comes into a DB, it is analyzed and then cached somewhere.
% Then following queries for the cached statement use the cached version.
% think 'cursor' views in other DBs
% what is cached is a fun/1 that takes the context node.
% this should all make the analysis phase rather cheap for any given node.
% also, statistics can be updated, meaning that the cache is dropped and rebuilt
% the next time each statement is run. this adds some overhead after a
% statistics run, but also makes for a smaller cache and better plans later.

%%% XXX
%% path statements in `for` loops should cache results for all items in list
%% grouped by item id. then use a map to find the results for each id
% document has path []
%% predicates can function the same way. The predicate runs first, and filters
% the actual items that could match. A predicate should be smaller or the
% same size as the orignal list.
%% where statements act as predicates on the variable tuple. See if they
% can also be used as a predicate

%% self              : ID

%% need to make decision on whether to use path of node id
%% known path from root, or descendant skips == use PATH because it is known
%% following/preceding NEVER path, but could be in filter when name known
%% PATH can be used in `lists:member` filter from node id

%% API
% paths statement should be list of {axis, node-kind, node-name, [filters (on built items)]}
% initial function is fn(Nodes, PathList)

%% think RDBMS cursor with binding varaibles

%%% PATH ANALYSIS
%% path analysis gives a list of path statments, each with reference to each other
% this can be used to find all path ids that will occur.
% each sub-selection becomes a fun that uses the prefix from the original node
% and the known path as a filter.
%% each fun can be created when the first nodes are selected, then passed around
% as variables when needed.
%% single attribute on unknown node can be select nodeid len + 1, where att
% multiple att for same node can all be selected at once


% scope     : database or document
% path      : known path to node
% rel_path  : partially known path to node -> causes unions
% node_value: value lookup to node
% doc_value : value lookup to node in document

% all axes can be done using the dewey id
% node name and value id can be in properties of a node record

% index levels : DB and DOC
% fields       : path, str_value, dbl_value, int_value (values are map val to string id)
%                string_id -> node/doc
%                nodes => node_id to node body/type/name/etc.
% node id == [DocId, Path, To, Node] upon build, DBId (Node/Num) prepended to Id

%% collection should return list of {node(), DBs}
%% at collection level, we need to find the documents that could answer the query,
%% then use the document ids in following queries

%% first focus on document level queries, adding DB layer on top is easy.
% makes each data access iterator do append joins in document-order

%% 1. get all path IDs that can point to the nodes, the count of paths might be high...
%% 2. do an iterator join on selection of every path, this gives node ids and paths

%% predicates with paths... multiple selections of node ids, joined at the returned node id
%% path is LHS, Path + Pred is RHS
%% /a/b/c[d] ==
%% {a,b,c} + {a,b,c,d} = all c from first where c == c from second (common prefix)

%% /a/b/c == [{_,a},{_,b},{_,c}]
%% /a//c  == [{_,a}|_] where lists:last() = c
%% /a//b/c  == [{_,a}|_] where ends with [{_,b},{_,c}]


%% logical query transformation == static-time full path resolution

% Path unknown == hard-way, path known == easy way  (path knowledge happens at static time)
% paths hidden in function are done the hard way unless can be easily found statically

% perhaps, build nodes after a flwor statement?? once all else is unknown
% they will most-likely be used in constructors anyway...

%% try to use the `return` portion as the driving factor with path expressions.

%% path on variable used in a for expression is grouped at the level of the for variable
%% predicates are grouped at level of the context item

% imagine a tree of functions, each calling callbacks with each tuple
% data access iterators can be handed to functions, each doing something
% and then calling other functions at the end, or returning....

% a `for` or `let` statement that is a path with no predicate is equal to just
% the path id for follow on expressions

% an unfiltered `for` with follow-on paths, means pull all at the follow-on
% paths, group by variable path depth
% caveate here is if there is a where filtering the `for` path statement
% this can mean pulling in a LOT of data when only a small portion is needed.
%  Maybe, for now, allow this to suck, and force the programmer to put this in
%  a predicate?

% truly need a FLWOR re-write of path statements to reverse lookups on
% filtered results

% TODO figure out how to put `where` statements in a predicate, if possible
% conditional statements in a where are split into two `let` statements.

% a filtered `for` with follow on paths, means pull all the ids for the loop
% make a function for each follow on that takes the ID as a parameter

% if nodes are collection, split all by DB, then doc
% function returned from each access by the query-server could start:
% 1. get node path from input node
% 2. check if path is cached for this db (if not get it)
% 3. add new path/s to this path
% 4. check cost for the statement
% 5. do which ever is cheapest (path -> structure, structure -> path, value -> path, etc.)
% 6. return node list as iterator, also put the returned nodes in record-format.
%
% ** calling process can shoot off as many calls it needs at once.
%     then loop all those calls to build the lists.

%% in-mem nodes also go through the fun-making process, only these functions
% take the node tree and return whatever is needed by traversing the tree.
% the functions made here are done in the calling process, not a server.


%% the calling process has to keep the path function for each call to the same DB, for the same path (caching)
% input may not be sorted, should be before first path statement
% these calls should be done in parallel accross different DBs
% a query should know if it is handling collection calls, then it can split the
% queries in static time, or add a DB split function when nodes are selected
% a query may also know that all nodes are coming from only one location, if
% that is the case, simplify everything.


% making dynamic funs is easy, use a map of all values and use the map as the
% match out.

% path analysis part, get all paths that can answer a query from all locations
%  example, all paths that when given a child with name N answer the query.
%  this list of all paths is put in a map and used in a fun as the match
% path 1,2,3 can answer .//x then #{1 => x, 2 => x, 3 => x}
% fun(Path) when is_map_key(Path, Map) -> NewPath; (_) -> [] end.
% could make this fun for all axes and names...

%% path statement using node id: find the 'highest' path expression
% meaning the closest to the root of the tree. Then go get all the nodes...
% use that list as the base for the following steps one-by-one
% this could suck, but that is likely the fault of crappy queries and not
% having crazy path rewrite optimizations...

% queries can use the structure index if the list of paths is small.
% also structure queries should only happen with simple forward axes (or maybe parent)
% where the base node-id can be filtered on.
