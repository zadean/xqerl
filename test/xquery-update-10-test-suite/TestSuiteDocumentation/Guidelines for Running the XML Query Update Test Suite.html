<h1 style="text-align: center;">Guidelines for Running the XML Query Update
Test Suite</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This document provides information to implementers who wish to run the
XQuery Update Test Suite (XQUTS) on their implementation. It includes
guidelines how test cases can be customized in order to run on an
implementation, and describes the process of evaluating the results. The
documentation of the XML Query Update Test Suite, which defines the structure
of the test cases and the catalog, can be found in [1]. Guidelines for
submitting results to the XML Query Working Group can be found in [3].</p>

<h1>Obtaining a Test Harness</h1>

<p>Implementers are expected to write their own test harness that implements
the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read test cases from the catalog</li>
  <li>Deciding which test cases to run</li>
  <li>Execute each test case by:
    <ul>
      <li>Applying customization, if applicable (see below)</li>
      <li>Reading the source files specified in the catalog</li>
      <li>Executing the queries in each of the query states (in order)</li>
      <li>Using the appropriate comparators to match the results</li>
      <li>Categorizing the test result (pass, fail, etc., see below)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Produce a file containing the results of the test run</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, the test harness produces an XML file containing all test results
in the format shown below, that can be sent to the working group.</p>

<p>The test cases in this test suite are independent of each other, and so
can be executed in any order. As test case execution may modify source
documents, it is the responsibility of the test harness to return the source
documents to their original state before executing any subsequent test cases.
Test sources <code>putOutput</code> and <code>putOutput2</code> refer to
files that do not exist. A test harness should delete documents written to
these locations after each test case has been run.</p>

<h1>Deciding which test cases to run</h1>

<p>Some features in the specification are optional or implementation-defined.<p>
    
<p>Where a test depends on an optional or implementation-defined feature then it is
    placed in a test group whose group information includes a <code>depends-on</code>
    element to document the dependency. The names of these features appear (with their meanings)
    in the enumeration type <code>feature-enum</code> in the schema for the test catalog.
    For example, <code>static-typing</code> labels tests that depend on the static typing
    and <code>revalidation:strict</code> depends on revalidation mode strict being supported.
    If the <code>feature</code> element specifies <code>supported="true"</code> (the default)
    then the tests in this group should be run only if the product supports the feature; if it specifies
    <code>supported="false"</code> then it should be run only if the product does not support the feature.
    If more than one <code>feature</code> element is present then the tests should be run only
if all the conditions are satisfied.</p>

<p>One of the purposes of this test suite is to collect data on how many products support
    optional features. Therefore, products should not attempt to run tests unless they 
implement the relevant feature.</p>

<h1>Test Suite Customization</h1>

<p>In order to run the test suite on an XQuery implementation, implementers
may customize the test suite and make a number of well-defined changes to the
test cases. All changes made to the original test suite must be documented in
free-text form as part of the result submission. Changes beyond the ones
listed below must be highlighted.</p>

<h2>Accessing Source Documents</h2>

<p>XQuery supports a number of different ways to refer to source data as
query context. Among these are the context item, external variables, the
fn:doc() function, the fn:collection() function, implementation-defined
functions, or parameter passing through host-language binding. Test cases
that do not refer to any input document (i.e., the catalog does not contain
any &ldquo;input-file&rdquo; for the &ldquo;test-case&rdquo;) do not need to
be customized in this way. Sometimes the filename "emptydoc" is used to
indicate this situation.</p>

<p>The following example is a customizable test case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>(: Name: id-insert-expr-06 :)
(: Description: Evaluation of simple insert expression that uses "after" clause only for an attribute. :)

(: insert-start :)
declare variable $input-context external;
(: insert-end :)


let $var := $input-context/works[1]/employee[3]
return 
  do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>and the corresponding catalog entry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;test-case name="id-insert-expr-06" FilePath= ... &gt;
  &lt;description&gt;Evaluates a simple insert expression with "after" clause only. ... &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;spec-citation spec="XQUPDATE" section-number="2.4.1" ...  section-pointer="#id-insert"/&gt;
  &lt;state time="0"&gt;
    &lt;query name="id-insert-expr-06" date="2007-06-04"/&gt;
    &lt;input-file role="principal-data" variable="input-context"&gt;works-mod&lt;/input-file&gt;
  &lt;/state&gt;
  &lt;state time="1"&gt;    
    &lt;query name="id-insert-expr-06-test" date="2007-06-04"/&gt;
    &lt;input-file role="principal-data" variable="input-context"&gt;works-mod&lt;/input-file&gt;                        
    &lt;output-file role="principal" compare="Fragment"&gt;id-insert-expr-06.xml&lt;/output-file&gt;
  &lt;/state&gt;
 &lt;/test-case&gt;</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>A test harness may use any of the following customizations of the query
that is supplied. Note that option 3 and 5 are only applicable for test cases
that use one source document.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unchanged: use external variables as indicated in the original query.
    <p>Users of static typing may choose to transform the variable
    declarations between insert-start and insert-end comments by adding an
    "as document-node()" clause as illustrated below:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>(: Name: id-insert-expr-06 :)
(: Description: Evaluation of simple insert expression that uses "after" clause only for an attribute. :)

(: insert-start :)
declare variable $input-context as document-node() external;
(: insert-end :)

let $var := $input-context/works[1]/employee[3]
return 
  do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Implicit variable declaration: Remove variable declarations between
    insert-start and insert-end comments. The implementation binds the input
    context to the variable $input-context.

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>(: Name: id-insert-expr-06 :)
(: Description: Evaluation of simple insert expression that uses "after" clause only for an attribute. :)

let $var := $input-context/works[1]/employee[3]
return 
  do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Implicit context: Remove variable declarations between insert-start and
    insert-end comments, and replace the variable references with the context
    item (.).

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>(: Name: id-insert-expr-06 :)
(: Description: Evaluation of simple insert expression that uses "after" clause only for an attribute. :)

let $var := ./works[1]/employee[3]
return 
  do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>doc function: Remove variable declarations between insert-start and
    insert-end comments, and replace variable references with the
    fn:doc(someURI), where someURI is a URI that the test harness has
    associated with the input file.

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>(: Name: id-insert-expr-06 :)
(: Description: Evaluation of simple insert expression that uses "after" clause only for an attribute. :)

let $var := fn:doc("works-mod.xml")/works[1]/employee[3]
return 
  do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var&gt;</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Default collection function: Remove variable declarations between
    insert-start and insert-end comments, and replace variable references
    with fn:collection().

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>    
(: Name: id-insert-expr-06 :)
(: Description: Evaluation of simple insert expression that uses "after" clause only for an attribute. :)

let $var := fn:collection()/works[1]/employee[3]
return 
  do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Collection function: Remove variable declarations between insert-start
    and insert-end comments, and replace variable references with
    fn:collection(someURI) , where someURI is a URI that the test harness has
    associated with the collection identified by the input file.

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>(: Name: id-insert-expr-06 :)
(: Description: Evaluation of simple insert expression that uses "after" clause only for an attribute. :)

let $var := fn:collection("file:collection1")/works[1]/employee[3]
return 
  do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Implementation-defined function: Remove variable declarations between
    insert-start and insert-end comments, and replace variable references
    with an implementation-defined function resolving to the input context.

    <blockquote>
      <pre><code>      
(: Name: id-insert-expr-06 :)
(: Description: Evaluation of simple insert expression that uses "after" clause only for an attribute. :)

let $var := impl-fn:impl-udf("works-mod.xml")/works[1]/employee[3]
return 
  do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var</code></pre>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1>Query States</h1>

<p>A test case may define one or more states (using a &lt;test-case&gt;
element and &lt;state&gt; elements). A &lt;state&gt; element may define: <ul>
  <li>A &lt;query&gt; element that defines a query (via the "name"
    attribute). Each query defined via the &lt;state&gt; element must be run
    in the exact order they are defined as each state is aware of any changes
    performed by the previous state(s) and depend on those states to execute
    correctly. Therefore all queries defined on a previous state must execute
    correctly before the next one can execute.</li>
  <li>Zero or more &lt;input-file&gt; elements, which defines any input data
    sources required for this state.</li>
  <li>Zero or more &lt;output-file&gt; elements, which will contain the
    expected results for this state.</li>
  <li>Zero or more &lt;expected-error&gt; elements, which define the expected
    errors (if any) for this state.</li>
</ul>
A query may define both an &lt;output-file&gt; and an &lt;expected-error&gt;
element. If the same data source is used for multiple states, then that data
source should not be set to its original state until the last state is
executed. The queries defined within a &lt;state&gt; element can be
customized using any of the approaches defined in the previous section.</p>

<p>A test case is successful if each of its states is successful. Each state
falls into one of these categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li>no expected results or errors - the state is successful if no error is
    detected</li>
  <li>one or more expected results, no expected errors - the state is
    successful only if the actual result matches one of the expected
  results</li>
  <li>one or more expected errors, no expected results - the state is
    successful if one of the expected errors is raised</li>
  <li>one or more expected results and one or more expected errors - the
    state is successful only if the actual result matches one of the expected
    results or one of the expected errors is raised</li>
</ol>

<p>A source document may be updated in one state and queried in a subsequent
state. Implementations may a) use the XDM instance that is produced by the
updating state in the subsequent state, or b) serialize the updated document
at the end of the updating state and then parse and validate the document in
the subsequent state. Most test cases will execute successfully with either
of these two approaches. A small number of test cases, found in the
RemoveType and StrictRevalidation groups, will execute successfully only with
the first approach.</p>

<h1>Host Language Binding</h1>

<p>Test cases can be embedded in a host language, for example using the
xmlquery function in SQL. This may require escaping certain characters like
quotes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>select xmlquery('let $var := $input-context/works[1]/employee[3]
return do insert attribute type {"Part Time"} after $var'
                passing xmlcol as "input-context")
from works-mod</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<!--
<h1>External Variables</h1>

<p>External variable tests (with our without types) are designed to use the
results of executing the query(s) specified by the &lt;input-query&gt;
element, also known as the input query (please note that there could be more
than one &lt;input-query&gt; element). The following guidelines are suggested
to properly execute these tests.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The &lt;input-query&gt; element specifies the query name via the "name"
    attribute and a variable via the "variable" attribute.</li>
  <li>Implementors should execute the input query(s) and bind its results to
    the corresponding "variable" attribute.</li>
  <li>The main query is specified via the &lt;query&gt; element. The main
    query will declare one or more external variables, whose names
    corresponds to the variables defined in the input query.</li>
  <li>Implementors should bind the values of the variables defined in the
    input-query(s) to the variable(s) defined in the main query.</li>
  <li>The main query should then be executed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following fragment from the catalog file illustrates the usage of the
parameters described above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;test-case name="extvardeclwithtype-17" ...&gt;
   &lt;description&gt;External Variable used to evaluate a boolean expression ... .&lt;/description&gt;
   &lt;spec-citation spec="XQuery" section-number="4.14" ... /&gt;
   &lt;state time = "0"&gt;
    &lt;query name="extvardeclwithtype-17" date="2006-02-09"/&gt;
    &lt;input-file role="principal-data" variable="input-context"&gt;emptydoc&lt;/input-file&gt;
    &lt;input-query variable="x" name="extvardeclwithtypetobind-17" date="2006-02-09"/&gt;
    &lt;output-file role="principal" compare="Text"&gt;extvardeclwithtype-17.txt&lt;/output-file&gt;
   &lt;/state&gt;
&lt;/test-case&gt;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
-->

<h1>Boundary-space Customization</h1>

<p>The test cases and their associated results have been written with an
expectation that the default value for the Boundary-space policy is strip. If
necessary, a test harness may transform their queries by adding "declare
boundary-space strip;" for those queries that do not already contain a
Boundary-space Declaration.</p>

<h1>Customizing XQueryX Tests</h1>

<p>Customizing XQueryX tests must follow the same rules provided above.
However, the XQueryX test cases do not include the insert-start/insert-end
comments surrounding external variable declaration and schema import.
Therefore, a test harness must find the items to be customized in the XQueryX
document using the information found in the catalog. The external variable
declaration and variable references in the XQueryX document typically looks
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre><code>&lt;xqx:varDecl&gt;
  &lt;xqx:varName&gt;input-context&lt;/xqx:varName&gt;
  &lt;xqx:external/&gt;
&lt;/xqx:varDecl&gt;

&lt;xqx:varRef&gt;
  &lt;xqx:name&gt;input-context&lt;/xqx:name&gt;
&lt;/xqx:varRef&gt;</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<h1>Comparing Results</h1>

<p>In order to check correctness of running a test case state, the result of
the implementation must be compared to the result provided in the test suite.
The implementation's result of the test case state must be serialized and
compared to the expected file(s) provided in the test suite. Serialization
should be performed as described in XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 Serialization [4]
with method="xml". The catalog defines for each test case, which of the
following five comparators has to be applied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>XML: The test harness must canonicalize both, the actual result and the
    expected result according to the &ldquo;Canonical XML&rdquo;
    recommendation [2], which refers to a number of open-source
    implementations. Byte-comparison can then be applied to the resulting XML
    documents. If the test harness does this process in a different manner,
    it must be documented.</li>
  <li>XML fragment: For XML fragments, the same root node must be created for
    both, implementation result and test suite result. The resulting XML can
    be compared using XML comparison.</li>
  <li>Text: Same comparison as "XML fragment".</li>
  <li>Ignore: no comparison needs to be applied; the result is always true if
    the implementation successfully executes the test case.</li>
  <li>Inspect: A human is required to make the call about correctness of the
    result according to the description in the test case.</li>
  <li>Error: The expected result of the test case state is an error,
    identified as an eight-character error code (e.g., XPST0003). The result
    of a test is true, if the implementation raises an error. However,
    raising an error because an implementation does not support the feature
    is not considered a correct result.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible that a test case state provides multiple expected results.
In this case, successfully comparing the actual result to one of the provided
expected results is a "pass".</p>

<p>Many tests involve operations on floats/doubles and converting those
results to strings. Even as one explicit value is given, the task force
realizes that other values may also be acceptable. In such cases submitters
are encouraged to submit values that may differ. The task force will
eventually determine if such values are within the acceptable range.</p>

<p>If all states of a test case "pass", then the result for the test case is
a "pass". Otherwise, the result for the test case is a "fail".</p>

<p>The expected files provided in the test suite are serialized forms as
specified by XML Query Serialization, with the following parameter values:</p>
