<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The XQuery Update Facility Test Suite (XQUTS) was designed to test whether
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-update-10/">W3C XQuery Update
Facility</a> can be implemented interoperably as published. If you have
implemented the XQuery Update Facility, using this test suite facility is a
good way to ensure that your implementation follows the specification, and to
identify aspects of the specification that should be changed if there are
implementability issues. Sending us your test suite results helps the XML Query
Working Group to satisfy the requirements to progress toward W3C Recommendation
status.</p>

<p>Use CVS to get the test suite:</p>
<pre>$ export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@dev.w3.org:/sources/public"
$ cvs login
(Logging in to anonymous@dev.w3.org)
CVS password: anonymous
$ cvs get 2007/xquery-update-10-test-suite/ </pre>

<p>You can also browse the testsuite using CVSWeb at <a
href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2007/xquery-update-10-test-suite/">http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2007/xquery-update-10-test-suite/</a>.</p>

<p>The XQuery Update Facility Test Suite contains <!-- over 1,400
test cases. It contains -->a catalog that contains general information on the
test suite as well as test descriptions for each of the test cases included in
this release. Test queries and expected results are contained in individual
files. All interpretations of this Recommendation are subject to confirmation
by the XML Query Working Group.</p>

<p>Implementors are encouraged 1) to write a harness for this test suite and to
test their implementations and 2) to report their results to the XML Query
Working Group. All of these areas are discussed in greater detail below.</p>

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>XQUTS 1.0.1 reflects the third publication of the W3C XQuery Update Facility
Candidate Recommendation (published on June 9, 2009). It reflects changes that
have been made to XQUTS 1.0.0 in response to public comments.</p>

<p>We have provided <a href="release_notes.html">release notes</a> that
describe the changes that have been applied to each version of this test
suite.</p>

<h1>Running the Test Suite</h1>

<p>We encourage you, the implementors of the XQuery Update Facility, to run
these tests and send us your results. These results will help us exit Candidate
Recommendation (described in the W3C <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">Process</a>).</p>

<p>As there is no de jure or de facto API for implementations of XQuery, we are
not able to provide a test harness to execute these tests. You will have to
write your own test harnesses.</p>

<p>We have provided <a
href="TestSuiteDocumentation/Guidelines%20for%20Running%20the%20XML%20Query%20Update%20Test%20Suite.html">Guidelines
for Running the XML Query Update Test Suite</a> to assist you in running these
tests. These guidelines will tell you how the queries may be modified before
they are executed and how to compare your actual results with the expected
results that we have provided.</p>

<h2>Reporting a Problem</h2>

<p>If you believe that some of the queries or their expected results are
incorrect, then we encourage you to enter bug reports in the public instance of
Bugzilla at W3C, <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/">http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/</a>.
Please include the query and test results you believe are correct as
attachments to the bug report.</p>

<p>To enter a bug report you will need a Bugzilla signon (email address and
password). You can create this signon by following the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/createaccount.cgi">Open a new Bugzilla
account</a> link on the Bugzilla Main Page. General information on Bugzilla, an
open-source bug tracking system, is available at <a
href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">http://www.bugzilla.org/</a>. The standard
documentation for the version currently being run on the W3C server is
available at <a
href="http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/2.20/html/">http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/2.20/html/</a>.</p>

<p>To enter a bug report in Bugzilla you will need to log in, choose the action
"New", and then choose the "XQuery Update Facility Test Suite" product. Please
be specific about the problem that you are reporting. Clearly identify the test
case or test cases that are problematic. If you believe that the expected
result is wrong, then tell us what result you believe is correct. If you
believe that another result for a test case is justified, then please tell us
what it is. In both cases, please cite portions of one or more of the XQuery
specifications that support your position.</p>

<h1>Submission of Test Suite Results</h1>

<p>When you are ready to submit your results to us, we ask that you follow the
guidelines provided in <a
href="TestSuiteDocumentation/Guidelines%20for%20Submitting%20XQUTS%20Test%20Results.html">Guidelines
for Submitting XML Query Update Test Suite Results</a>. These guidelines will
tell you how to generate an XML result document that we can use to generate our
reports. They will also tell you how to generate your own report from the XML
result file.</p>

<p>If you have indicated that you wish your results to be displayed as
“Anonymous”, then please send them to the XML Query WG Team Contact, <a
href="mailto:liam@w3.org">Liam Quin</a>. Otherwise, please send them to <a
href="mailto:andrew.eisenberg@us.ibm.com">Andrew Eisenberg</a>, cc'ing <a
href="mailto:www-archive@w3.org">www-archive@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage you to send us results early, and then to send us updates as
the XQuery Update Facility Test Suite progresses and as your implementation
progresses.</p>
<!--
<h1>Submission of Test Cases</h1>

<p>We welcome submissions of test cases from individuals and organizations
that are not already participating in the XML Query Working Group. We
encourage you to look at <a
href="Guidelines%20for%20Test%20Submission.html">Guidelines for XML Query
Test Suite Submissions</a> so that the test cases that you submit can be
added easily to our test suite.</p>

<p>If you would like to submit test cases, then you must:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Register for a W3C account. You can request one through the <a
    href="http://cgi.w3.org/MemberAccess/Public">Public Access Request
    Form</a>.</li>
  <li>Submit your test cases using <a>Grant II: Grant of License for
    Contributed Test Cases Published Outside a W3C Recommendation</a>. This
    license grant, for non-Participant test case Contributors, is described
    in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/10/27-testcases.html">Policies for
    Contribution of Test Cases to W3C</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XML Query Working Group, at its sole discretion, determines
what tests are incorporated in the test suite.</p> -->
